HMMRATAC, first released as a JAVA program in 2019, is a dedicated
tool specifically designed for processing ATAC-seq data. In MACS3, it
has been integrated as a subcommand (`hmmratac`). Reimagined and
rewritten in Python and Cython, this tool's functionality might vary
from its JAVA version. The core principle of HMMRATAC involves
utilizing the Hidden Markov Model to learn the nucleosome structure
around open chromatin regions.

Here's an example of how to run the `hmmratac` command:

```
$ macs3 hmmratac -b test/yeast_500k_SRR1822137.bam -n hmmratac_yeast500k
```

Before proceeding, it's essential to carefully read the help messages
concerning each option and the default parameters. There are several
crucial parameters we usually need to specify:

1. Lower cutoff to select training regions through `-l`.
2. Upper cutoff to select training regions through `-u`.
3. Pre-scanning cutoff to select candidate regions for
   decoding/predicting the states, including open, nucleosome, and
   background states, through `-c`.

These three parameters can significantly influence the
results. Therefore, it's highly recommended to run `macs3 hmmratac
--cutoff-analysis-only -b your.bam` first, which will help you decide
the parameters for `-l`, `-u`, and `-c`. Since there isn't an
automatic way to determine these parameters, your judgement will be
vital. Please read the output from `macs3 hmmratac
--cutoff-analysis-only -b your.bam` and the following section `Choices
of cutoff values` for guidance.

* Choices of cutoff values *

Before you proceed, it's highly recommended to run with
`--cutoff-analysis-only` for the initial attempt. When this option is
activated, `hmmratac` will use EM to estimate the best parameters for
fragment sizes of short fragments, mono-, di-, and tri-nucleosomes,
pileup fragments, convert the pileup values into fold-change, and
analyze each possible cutoff. This analysis includes the number of
peaks that can be called, their average peak length, and their total
length. After the report is generated, you can review its contents and
decide on the optimal `-l`, `-u`, and `-c`.

The report consists of four columns:

1. score: the possible fold change cutoff value.
2. npeaks: the number of peaks under this cutoff.
3. lpeaks: the total length of all peaks.
4. avelpeak: the average length of peaks.

While there's no universal rule, here are a few suggestions:

- The lower cutoff should be the cutoff in the report that captures a
  moderate number (about 10k-30k) of peaks with a normal width (average
  length 500-1000bps long).
- The upper cutoff should capture some (typically hundreds of)
  extremely high enrichment and unusually wide peaks in the
  report. The aim here is to exclude abnormal enrichment caused by
  artifacts such as repetitive regions.
- The pre-scanning cutoff should be the cutoff close to the BOTTOM of
  the report that can capture a large number of potential peaks with a
  normal length (average length 500-1000bps). However, it's
  recommended not to use the lowest cutoff value in the report as this
  may include too much noise from the genome.
  
* Tune the HMM model *

It's highly recommended to check the runtime message of the HMM model
after training. An example is like this:

```
#4 Train Hidden Markov Model with Multivariate Gaussian Emission
#  Extract signals in training regions with bin size of 10
#  Use Baum-Welch algorithm to train the HMM
#   HMM converged: True
#  Write HMM parameters into JSON: test_model.json
#  The Hidden Markov Model for signals of binsize of 10 basepairs:
#   open state index: state2
#   nucleosomal state index: state1
#   background state index: state0
#   Starting probabilities of states:
#                            bg        nuc       open
#                        0.7994     0.1312    0.06942
#   HMM Transition probabilities:
#                            bg        nuc       open
#               bg->     0.9842    0.01202   0.003759
#              nuc->    0.03093     0.9562    0.01287
#             open->   0.007891    0.01038     0.9817
#   HMM Emissions (mean):
#                         short       mono         di        tri
#               bg:      0.2551      1.526     0.4646    0.07071
#              nuc:       6.538      17.94      3.422    0.05819
#             open:       5.016      17.47      6.897      2.121
```

We will 'guess' which hidden state is for the open region, which is
the nucleosomal region, and which is the background. We compute from
the HMM Emission matrix to pick the state with the highest sum of mean
signals as the open state, the lowest as the backgound state, then the
rest is the nucleosomal state. However it may not work in every
case. In the above example, it may be tricky to call the second row as
'nuc' and the third as 'open'. If the users want to exchange the state
assignments of the 'nuc' and 'open', they can modify the state
assignment in the HMM model file (e.g. test_model.json). For the above
example, the model.json looks like this (we skipped some detail):

```
{"startprob": [...], "transmat": [...], "means": [...], "covars": [...], 
"covariance_type": "full", "n_features": 4, 
"i_open_region": 2, "i_background_region": 0, "i_nucleosomal_region": 1,
"hmm_binsize": 10}
```

We can modify the assignment of: `"i_open_region": 2,
"i_background_region": 0, "i_nucleosomal_region": 1,` by assigning `1`
to open, and `2` to nucleosomal as: `"i_open_region": 1,
"i_background_region": 0, "i_nucleosomal_region": 2,` Then save the
HMM in a new model file such as `new_model.json`.

Then next, we can re-run `macs3 hmmratac` with the same parameters
plus an extra option for the HMM model file like `macs3 hmmratac
--model new_model.json`
