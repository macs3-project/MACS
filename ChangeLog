2011-12-07  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Version 1.4.2

	* Default options changes

	1. --to-small is replaced by --to-large. Now the default behavior
	is to scale down larger sample. In this way, results would be more
	specific, because noises would increase slower than real enriched
	regions.

	2. --off-auto is replaced by --on-auto. Now the auto-fix of
	modeled fragment size is turned off by default. Previously, if the
	d from MACS is smaller than 2 times of read length, MACS will use
	2 times of --shiftsize setting instead. This may lead to unwanted
	result, especially when sequencing read length gets longer. It has
	been turned off by default now, if you still want this feature,
	please use '--off-auto' and '--shiftsize' with desired number.

	3. --keep-dup is by default 1. To keep only one tag per position,
	always performs better than keep multiple, from our internal tests.

	* PeakSplitter for bedGraph output as well

	* SAMParser and BAMParser fixed for paired-end sequencing
	data. Thanks to Benjamin Schiller!

2011-06-21  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Version 1.4.1

	* PeakDetect.py

	Fix a bug, correctly assign lambda_bg while --to-small is
	set. Thanks Junya Seo!

	Fix a bug to allow minus strand containing NO tags at all. Thank
	Vaibhav Jain for bringing up this problem!

	Correctly use user-specified tag size while -s/--tsize is
	set. Thank Shunmin He for the bug report!

2011-06-19  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Version 1.4.0

	* Parser.py

	Change all split() to split('\t'), so that MACS now split columns
	in input reads alignment file only using tab.

	* elandexport2bed.py, elandmulti2bed.py, elandresult2bed.py, sam2bed.py

	.py are all removed, so the commands are elandexport2bed,
	elandmulti2bed, elandresult2bed and sam2bed.

2011-02-28  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Small fixes

	* Replaced with a newest WigTrackI class and fixed the wignorm script.

2011-02-21  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Version 1.4.0rc2 (Valentine)

	* --single-wig option is renamed to --single-profile

	* BedGraph output with --bdg or -B option.

	The BedGraph output provides 1bp resolution fragment pileup
	profile. File size is smaller than wig file. This option can be
	combined with --single-profile option to produce a bedgraph file
	for the whole genome. This option can also make --space,
	--call-subpeaks invalid.

	* Fix the description of --shiftsize to correctly state that the
	value is 1/2 d (fragment size).

	* Fix a bug in the call to __filter_w_control_tags when control is
	not available.

	* Fix a bug on --to-small option. Now it works as expected.

	* Fix a bug while counting the tags in candidate peak region, an
	extra tag may be included. (Thanks to Jake Biesinger!)

	* Fix the bug for the peaks extended outside of chromosome
	start. If the minus strand tag goes outside of chromosome start
	after extension of d, it will be thrown out.

	* Post-process script for a combined wig file:

	The "wignorm" command can be called after a full run of MACS14 as
	a postprocess. wignorm can calculate the local background from the
	control wig file from MACS14, then use either foldchange,
	-10*log10(pvalue) from possion test, or difference after asinh
	transformation as the score to build a single wig track to
	represent the binding strength. This script will take a
	significant long time to process.

	* --wigextend has been obsoleted.

2010-09-21  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Version 1.4.0rc1 (Starry Sky)

	* Duplicate reads option

	--keep-dup behavior is changed. Now user can specify how many
	reads he/she wants to keep at the same genomic location. 'auto' to
	let MACS decide the number based on binomial distribution, 'all'
	to let MACS keep all reads.

	* pvalue and FDR fixes (Thanks to Prof. Zhiping Weng)

	By default, MACS will now scale the smaller dataset to the bigger
	dataset. For instance, if IP has 10 million reads, and Input has 5
	million, MACS will double the lambda value calculated from Input
	reads while calling BOTH the positive peaks and negative
	peaks. This will address the issue caused by unbalanced numbers of
	reads from IP and Input. If --to-small is turned on, MACS will
	scale the larger dataset to the smaller one. So from now on, if d
	is fixed, then the peaks from a MACS call for A vs B should be
	identical to the negative peaks from a B vs A.

2010-09-01  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Version 1.4.0beta (summer wishes)

	* New features

	** Model building

	The default behavior in the model building step is slightly
	changed. When MACS can't find enough pairs to build model
	(implemented in alpha version) or the modeled fragment length is
	less than 2 times of tag length (implemented in beta version),
	MACS will use 2 times of --shiftsize value as fragment length in
	the later analysis. --off-auto can turn off this default behavior.

	** Redundant tag filtering

	The IO module is rewritten. The redundant tag filtering process
	becomes simpler and works as promise. The maximum allowed number
	of tags at the exact same location is calculated from the
	sequencing depth and genome size using a binomial distribution,
	for both TREAMENT and CONTROL separately. ( previously only
	TREATMENT is considered ) The exact same location means the same
	coordination and the same strand. Then MACS will only keep at most
	this number of tags at the exact same location in the following
	analysis. An option --keep-dup can let MACS skip the filtering and
	keep all the tags. However this may bring in a lot of sequencing
	bias, so you may get many false positive peaks.

	** Single wiggle mode

	First thing to mention, this is not the score track that I
	described before. By default, MACS generates wiggle files for
	fragment pileup for every chromosomes separately. When you use
	--single-wig option, MACS will generate a single wiggle file for
	all the chromosomes so you will get a wig.gz for TREATMENT and
	another wig.gz for CONTROL if available.

	** Sniff -- automatic format detection

	Now, by default or "-f AUTO", MACS will decide the input file
	format automatically. Technically, it will try to read at most
	1000 records for the first 10 non-comment lines. If it succeeds,
	the format is decided. I recommend not to use AUTO and specify the
	right format for your input files, unless you combine different
	formats in a single MACS run.

	* Options changes

	--single-wig and --keep-dup are added. Check previous section in
	ChangeLog for detail.

	-f (--format) AUTO is now the default option.

	--slocal default: 1000
	--llocal default: 10000

	* Bug fixed

	Setup script will stop the installation if python version is not
	python2.6 or python2.7.

	Local lambda calculation has been changed back. MACS will check
	peak_region, slocal( default 1K) and llocal (default 10K) for the
	local bias. The previous 200bps default will cause MACS misses
	some peaks where the input bias is very sharp.

	sam2bed.py script is corrected.

	Relative pos in xls output is fixed.

	Parser for ELAND_export is fixed to pass some of the no match
	lines. And elandexport2bed.py is fixed too. ( however I can't
	guarantee that it works on any eland_export files. )

2010-06-04  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Version 1.4.0alpha2 (be smarter)

	* Options changes

	--gsize now provides shortcuts for common genomes, including
	human, mouse, C. elegans and fruitfly.

	--llocal now will be 5000 bps if there is no input file, so that
	local lambda doesn't overkill enriched binding sites.

2010-06-02  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Version 1.4alpha (be smarter)
	
	* Options changes

	--tsize option is redesigned. MACS will use the first 10 lines of
	the input to decide the tag size. If user specifies --tsize, it
	will override the auto decided tsize.

	--lambdaset is replaced by --slocal and --llocal which mean the
	small local region and large local region. 

	--bw has no effect on the scan-window size now. It only affects the
	paired-peaks model process. 
	
	* Model building

	During the model building, MACS will pick out the enriched regions
	which are not too high and not too low to build the paired-peak
	model. Default the region is from fold 10 to fold 30. If MACS
	fails to build the model, by default it will use the nomodel
	settings, like shiftsize=100bps, to shift and extend each
	tags. This behavior can be turned off by '--off-auto'.

	* Output files

	An extra file including all the summit positions are saved in
	*_summits.bed file. An option '--call-subpeaks' will invoke
	PeakSplitter developed by Mali Salmon to split wide peaks into
	smaller subpeaks.
	
	* Sniff ( will in beta )

	Automatically recognize the input file format, so use can combine
	different format in one MACS run.

	Not implemented features/TODO:
	
	* Algorithms ( in near future? )

	MACS will try to refine the peak boundaries by calculating the
	scores for every point in the candidate peak regions. The score
	will be the -10*log(10,pvalue) on a local poisson distribution. A
	cutoff specified by users (--pvalue) will be applied to find the
	precise sub-peaks in the original candidate peak region. Peak
	boudaries and peak summits positions will be saved in separate BED
	files.

	* Single wiggle track ( in near future? )

	A single wiggle track will be generated to save the scores within
	candidate peak regions in the 10bps resolution. The wiggle file
	is in fixedStep format.

	Version 1.3.6.1 (default parameter change)
	
	* bin/macs, lib/PeakDetect.py

	"--oldfdr" is removed. The 'oldfdr' behaviour becomes
	default. "--futurefdr" is added which can turn on the 'new' method
	introduced in 1.3.6. By default it's off.

	* lib/PeakDetect.py

	Fixed a bug. p-value is corrected a little bit.
	

2009-05-11  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Version 1.3.6 (Birthday cake)
	
	* bin/macs

	"track name" is added to the header of BED output file.

	Now the default peak detection method is to consider 5k and 10k
	nearby regions in treatment data and peak location, 1k, 5k, and
	10k regions in control data to calculate local bias. The old
	method can be called through '--old' option.

	Information about how many total/unique tags in treatment or
	control will be saved in final .xls output.

	* lib/IO/__init__.py

	".fa" will be removed from input tag alignment so only the
	chromosome names are kept.

	WigTrackI class is added for Wiggle like data structure. (not used
	now)

	The parser for ELAND multi PET files has been fixed. Now the 5'
	tag position for a pair will be kept, whereas in the previous
	version, the middle points are kept.

	* lib/IO/BinKeeper.py

	BinKeeperI class is inspired by Jim Kent's library for UCSC genome
	browser, which can quickly access certain region for values in a
	large wiggle like data file. (not used now)

	* lib/OptValidator.py

	typo fixed.

	* lib/PeakDetect.py

	Now the default peak detection method is to consider 5k and 10k
	nearby regions in treatment data and peak location, 1k, 5k, and
	10k regions in control data to calculate local bias. The old
	method can be called through '--old' option.

	Two columns have beed added to BED output file. 4th column: peak
	name; 5th column: peak score using -10log(10,pvalue) as score.

	* setup.py

	Add support to build a Mac App through 'setup.py py2app', or a
	Windows executable through 'setup.py py2exe'. You need to install
	py2app or py2exe package in order to use these functions.

2009-02-12  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Version 1.3.5 (local lambda fixed, typo fixed, model figure improved)
	
	* PeakDetect.py

	Now, besides 1k, 5k, 10k, MACS will also consider peak size region
	in control data to calculate local lambda for each peak. Peak
	calling results will be slightly different with previous version,
	beware!

	* OptValidator.py

	Typo fixed, ELANDParser -> ELANDResultParser

	* OutputWriter.py

	Now, modeled d value will be shown on the model figure.

2009-01-06  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Version 1.3.4 (Happy New Year Version, bug fixed, ELAND multi/PET support)
	
	* macs, IO/__init__.py, PeakDetect.py

	Add support for ELAND multi format. Add support for Pair-End
	experiment, in this case, 5'end and 3'end ELAND multi format files
	are required for treatment or control data. See 00README file for
	detail.

	Add wigextend option.

	Add petdist option for Pair-End Tag experiment, which is the best
	distance between 5' and 3' tags.

	* PeakDetect.py

	Fixed a bug which cause the end positions of every peak region
	incorrectly added by 1 bp. ( Thanks Mali Salmon!)

	* OutputWriter.py
	
	Fix bugs while generating wiggle files. The start position of
	wiggle file is set to 1 instead of 0.

	Fix a bug that every 10M bps, signals in the first 'd' range are
	lower than actual. ( Thanks Mali Salmon!)


2008-12-03  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Version 1.3.3 (wiggle bugs fixed)
	
	* OutputWriter.py

	Fix bugs while generating wiggle files. 1. 'span=' is added to
	'variableStep' line; 2. previously, every 10M bps, the coordinates
	were wrongly shifted to the right for 'd' basepairs.

	* macs, PeakDetect.py

	Add an option to save wiggle files on different resolution.
	
2008-10-02  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Version 1.3.2 (tiny bugs fixed)

	* IO/__init__.py
	
	Fix 65536 -> 65535. ( Thank Joon) 
	
	* Prob.py
	
	Improved for binomial function with extra large number. Imported
	from Cistrome project.
	
	* PeakDetect.py

	If treatment channel misses reads in some chromosome included in
	control channel, or vice versa, MACS will not exit. (Thank Shaun
	Mahony)

	Instead, MACS will fake a tag at position -1 when calling
	treatment peaks vs control, but will ignore the chromosome while
	calling negative peaks.

2008-09-04  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Version 1.3.1 (tiny bugs fixed version)

	* Prob.py
	
	Hyunjin Gene Shin contributed some codes to Prob.py. Now the
	binomial functions can tolerate large and small numbers.
	
	* IO/__init__.py

	Parsers now split lines in BED/ELAND file using any
	whitespaces. 'track' or 'browser' lines will be regarded as
	comment lines. A bug fixed when throwing StrandFormatError. The
	maximum redundant tag number at a single position can be no less
	than 65536.

	
2008-07-15  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Version 1.3 (naming clarification version)

	* Naming clarification changes according to our manuscript:

	'frag_len' is changed to 'd'.

	'fold_change' is changed to 'fold_enrichment'.
	
	Suggest '--bw' parameter to be determined by users from the real
	sonication size.

	Maximum FDR is 100% in the output file.

	And other clarifications in 00README file and the documents on the
	website.
	
	* IO/__init__.py
	If the redundant tag number at a single position is over 32767,
	just remember 32767, instead of raising an overflow exception.
	
	* setup.py
	fixed a typo.

	* PeakDetect.py
	Bug fixed for diagnosis report.
	

2008-07-10  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Version 1.2.2gamma

	* Serious bugs fix: 

	Poisson distribution CDF and inverse CDF functions are
	corrected. They can produce right results even for huge lambda
	now. So that the p-value and FDR values in the final excel sheet
	are corrected.

	IO package now can tolerate some rare cases; ELANDParser in IO
	package is fixed. (Thank Bogdan)

	* Improvement:

	Reverse paired peaks in model are rejected. So there will be no
	negative 'frag_len'. (Thank Bogdan)

	* Features added:
	
	Diagnosis function is completed. Which can output a table file for
	users to estimate their sequencing depth.


2008-06-30  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Version 1.2
	
	* Probe.py is added!  

	GSL is totally removed from MACS. Instead, I have implemented the
	CDF and inverse CDF for poisson and binomial distribution purely
	in python.

	* Constants.py is added!

	Organize constants used in MACS in the Constants.py file.

	* All other files are modified!

	Foldchange calculation is modified. Now the foldchange only be
	calculated at the peak summit position instead of the whole peak
	region. The values will be higher and more robust than before.

	Features added:

	1. MACS can save wiggle format files containing the tag number at
	every 10 bp along the genome. Tags are shifted according to our
	model before they are calculated.

	2. Model building and local lambda calculation can be skipped with
	certain options.

	3. A diagnosis report can be generated through '--diag'
	option. This report can help you get an assumption about the
	sequencing saturation. This funtion is only in beta stage.

	4. FDR calculation speed is highly improved.
	
2008-05-28  Tao Liu  <taoliu@jimmy.harvard.edu>
	Version 1.1
	
	* TabIO, PeakModel.py ...
	Bug fixed to let MACS tolerate some cases while there is no tag on
	either plus strand or minus strand.

	* setup.py
	Check the version of python. If the version is lower than 2.4,
	refuse to install with warning.
